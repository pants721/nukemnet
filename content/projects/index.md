Projects I created:

- **[Skely](https://github.com/pants721/skely)**: A command line utility for managing and using template projects.
- **[pants721.github.io](https://github.com/pants721/pants721.github.io)**: This website (I think it's pretty cool).
- [hash_table.h](https://github.com/pants721/hash_table.h): A hash table implementation in C.
- [NBA News API](https://github.com/pants721/nba-news-api): Frontend and backend implementation for an NBA news API that scrapes headlines from top sources (more of a proof of concept).

Projects I've contributed to:

- [Julti](https://github.com/DuncanRuns/Julti): A program for multi-instancing Minecraft. I contributed a program launcher feature, as well a few small quality of life improvements.
