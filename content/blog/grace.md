i dont think ill ever fully understand it.<br/>
<br/>
ive spent my nights twisting and turning over how <br/>
one moment you're there and the next you're just not. <br/>
the sheets are all hot and horrible now and still understanding alludes me.<br/>

how wrong this is. to leave no mark in the sand, no note on the fridge, no reason why.<br/>
maybe a fool would see the long trail of sand that had been drudged through for years and scratch his head at it's end.<br/>
maybe i've been made a fool.<br/>
<br/>
death makes what it wants of me.<br/>
my notebook of coping strategies and meditations does me no good in the face of the great equalizer.<br/>
its very loud at first. it comes at you screaming and kicking; crying "how could it be".<br/>
shock subsides.<br/>
someone will tell you "the number 12 is everywhere" and it will feel as if the number 12 is haunting you.<br/>
you'll see it everywhere- buses, milk cartons, the time.<br/>
every turn of every corner of your day will find some cruel way to remind you of what you've lost.<br/>
a photo, or an odd possession of theirs might be expected to stir up some feelings,<br/>
but it sneaks into where you least expect it.<br/>
a song, a color, a face, a phrase that knocks the wind out of you as if the number 12 had learned muay thai.<br/>
and all of the sudden you're back at the start.<br/>
<br/>
where was i<br/>
where was i when it happened<br/>
what was i doing<br/>
what could i have done<br/>
why did she do it<br/>
why why why<br/>
<br/>
maybe she's happier now. maybe it truly was too much to bear.<br/>
but what could it have been that she had to bear it alone?<br/>
the weight of the world was never meant just for her, why did she insist upon holding it?<br/>
we were all here.<br/>
<br/>
the world has been robbed of its kindness and its beauty.<br/>
it seems shes taken it all with her<br/>
and left us.<br/>
<br/>
every memory, every moment, every photo is a reminder of how half of that story ends. how her story ended.<br/>
to look at a childhood photo and know what the you then didnt.<br/>
to know you'd be speaking at her funeral in 10 years.<br/>
<br/>
we were close back then, but we faded apart.<br/>
when i got to high school we reconnected, and the kindness she extended towards me changed my life.<br/>
it wasn't huge, but it was unconditional. i didn't even love myself unconditionally.<br/>
even for a small moment, i got to experience the kindness she had grown into.<br/>
we grew apart again when she went to college, which is fine. i don't blame either of us for falling out of touch.<br/>
i wish i had texted just once.<br/>
<br/>
i knew the depth of the person we were mourning that day. i understood it.<br/>
i felt a certain guilt being a speaker amongst her two best friends and her aunt, <br/>
but every word of their loving recollections felt all too familiar for me to be a stranger.<br/>
<br/>
she saw people for who they really are<br/>
<br/>
that one stuck in my head for the entire service.<br/>
what a wonderful gift. <br/>
to understand people. <br/>
and at that to understand them more than theyd like you to.<br/>
to understand who they are<br/>
not who they say they are<br/>
<br/>
she certainly understood me for who i was<br/>
underneath all those layers of embarassingly baggy clothes<br/>
and embarassingly smudged eyeliner<br/>
she understood me<br/>
<br/>
i wish she knew how much that meant to me.<br/>
i wish i could tell her.<br/>
<br/>
i love you so much<br/>
thank you for being you<br/>
you were always enough<br/>
<br/>
i dont know what i could've said to change her mind<br/>
i dont think im qualified to even brainstorm<br/>
but i know i wish she didn't<br/>
ive wished so hard; harder than i ever have, for longer than i ever have.<br/>
its been days and weeks<br/>
and it will be months and years and decades of wishing and wishing<br/>
my 30's and 40's will come and go and <br/>
i will still be wishing that kind, sweet girl i grew up with was still around to talk<br/>
<br/>
maybe by then i wouldve gotten to know her again<br/>
thats what stings the most<br/>
i didnt know her<br/>
i didnt know who shed grown into<br/>
<br/>
i knew her<br/>
thats it<br/>
now thats it<br/>
<br/>
i find myself mourning the amazing person she grew into<br/>
the amazing person that touched the lives of all three hundred people in that church<br/>
a feat im certain the 10 year old i was acquainted with was under-equipped for<br/>
<br/>
no, no<br/>
she was so much more than i ever knew<br/>
<br/>
i find myself mourning the person i never got to know<br/>
<br/>
it feels wrong<br/>
it feels dirty<br/>
like a trick has been played on me<br/>
<br/>
a certain eventually has been taken without any warning<br/>
maybe it was my fault for it being an eventually<br/>
why wasn't it just a now<br/>
<br/>
maybe that check in wouldve done it<br/>
maybe she wouldve thought not tonight<br/>
maybe she wouldve been just distracted enough with our memories together<br/>
i know just how distracting they are now<br/>
<br/>
the worst part<br/>
and i mean the worst part<br/>
<br/>
she doesnt know<br/>
she certainly didnt think about me in those last moments<br/>
or any of those other people in the church bar a few<br/>
she didnt picture me standing up there, <br/>
shaking as i read a sorry substitue for the words i wish i had told her<br/>
she didnt picture the tears, the screams, the absent staring into space for weeks on end<br/>
of every single person in that room.<br/>
<br/>
yet here i am writing about it.<br/>
crying through my fingers into my keyboard because tears wouldnt come close to enough.<br/>
so many people cared so much about her.<br/>
i wish she had known; maybe things would be different.<br/>
<br/>
i walked up onto the stand with my speech on my phone. <br/>
ive never been a poor public speaker, but up there it all hit me<br/>
the gravity, the grief, the realness, it was all there in that church air<br/>
staring at me<br/>
<br/>
i started my speech.<br/>
<br/>
people laughed<br/>
people cried<br/>
<br/>
as i approached the end, the emotion overtook me.<br/>
i couldnt do it<br/>
it was too much<br/>
i couldnt accept it in front of everyone<br/>
i didnt want it to be real<br/>
<br/>
i looked in her moms eyes<br/>
my aunt, as i called her<br/>
<br/>
i had been avoiding making eye contact. i had been a coward<br/>
the pain that she must have been going through is unimaginable<br/>
i was afraid that even eye contact would make me burst into tears<br/>
<br/>
but when i looked in her eyes<br/>
i saw so much love<br/>
for her daughter<br/>
that had been taken too soon from her<br/>
but it was love that was unpersuaded to let the footnote overtake the story<br/>
love that was unerased by grief<br/>
love that was unbothered by physical presence<br/>
love that saw her daughters presence in the lives of anyone who had been touched by her kindness.<br/>
love that told me to continue<br/>
to not let my grief stop me<br/>

> "<span style="color: purple;">i love you grace</span>"<br/>

so i ask of you this<br/>
just as you extend it unto others<br/>
please<br/>
please<br/>
<br/>
please<br/>
give yourself patience<br/>
give yourself kindness<br/>
give yourself compassion<br/>
give yourself grace<br/>
