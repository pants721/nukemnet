Hi everyone! For the past week or so I've been revisiting an old project of mine 
called [Skely](https://github.com/pants721/skely), which is a tool I wrote to 
help use and manage project templates (a.k.a. skeletons). The last time I 
touched the project was right over a year ago, around when I first started 
learning rust, so the code quality was not great. Since then, I've become an 
much much better developer and I want to look at some of my old code, look at 
the new code, and analyze why the new code is better. This won't be a complete 
code review, so if you're interested in the project's development make sure to 
check it out on [Github](https://github.com/pants721/skely)!
